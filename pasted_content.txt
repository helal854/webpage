Project Idea: Interactive Cryptocurrency Web Platform

Goal: Build a professional web platform offering the following core features:

Investment Profit Calculator

Calculate projected returns using compound interest for cryptocurrencies.

Real-time price integration via APIs (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap).

Dynamic results update without requiring a "submit" button.

Input sliders for variables like time, initial investment, and interest rate.

Bitcoin Mining Calculator

Estimate mining profitability based on:

Hash rate (with unit conversion, e.g., TH/s â†’ H/s).

Electricity costs and pool fees.

Integrate live data (Bitcoin price, network difficulty).

Toggle between currencies (USD, BTC) with instant updates.

Interactive Reports

Generate customizable reports (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/yearly).

Filter data by date, currency type, and profit range.

Visualize trends using dynamic charts (e.g., Chart.js).

Save user preferences (filters, themes) via localStorage.

PDF Export

Export reports to PDF with custom branding (logo, name, text).

Ensure PDFs retain interactive charts and tables as searchable text.

Support multilingual text (including Arabic fonts).

Frontend Technologies:

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5 (Grid, Components, Utilities).

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) or optional lightweight libraries (e.g., jQuery).

Additional libraries:

Chart.js for data visualization.

jsPDF or pdfmake for PDF generation.

date-fns for timezone-aware date handling.

Key Features:

Responsive design optimized for all devices.

Performance enhancements (lazy loading, debounce for inputs).

User-friendly UI with modals, tabs, and validation forms.

Customizable Bootstrap theme (colors, fonts, components).

Advanced Considerations:

Use Web Workers for heavy data processing.

Implement client-side authentication via Web Crypto API.

Unit testing for core calculations (e.g., hash rate conversion).
